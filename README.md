# Multi-Camera Person Re-Identification and Mapping

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project focuses on **multi-camera analysis** using:
- **Detection** (object bounding boxes + confidence filtering)  
- **Re-Identification (ReID)** with feature embeddings  
- **Mapping** from image coordinates to real-world plane via depth and calibration  

The system produces a **birdâ€™s-eye view plan** alongside video feeds, enabling consistent identity assignment and world-coordinate tracking.

## ðŸ”¹ Pipeline

1. - **Detection**: [YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) (fine-tuned on PhysicalAI-SmartSpaces/MTMC_Tracking_2025 dataset).
   - Real-time object detection with bounding boxes and confidence scores.  

2. - **Re-Identification (ReID)**: [TransReID-SSL](https://github.com/damo-cv/TransReID-SSL), fine-tuned on the PhysicalAI-SmartSpaces/MTMC_Tracking_2025/train/Warehouse_000 dataset.
   - Extracts embeddings for appearance matching.  
   - Uses **DBSCAN** to split duplicate IDs.  

3. **Mapping**  
   - Projects 2D bounding box points to 3D world coordinates using depth maps.  
   - Normalizes to 2D floor plan for visualization.  
   - Applies smoothing and median filtering to reduce jitter.

## ðŸ”¹ Demo Videos

Below are qualitative results.  
Each row shows multiple camera views, with the **center video being the global floor plan** (birdâ€™s-eye view).
